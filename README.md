# ChatBot User Interaction Analysis
Modeling comparison between TF-IDF and Word2Vec on NFA modeling

The project represents how the TF-IDF and Word2Vec contributes to analyze the current status of sentence input from the labelling training data with 1 (positive) and 0 (negative) attitude. While Part III of the project synthesizes and combines all procedures for the final product, part I and II will split the project into small problem to represent only training purpose or pre-processing purpose. There will be personal reports in the "Report" folder to compare among models and algorithm chosen. If you have any different perspective, please do not hesitate to contact me.
